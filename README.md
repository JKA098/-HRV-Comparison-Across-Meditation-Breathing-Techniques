# -HRV-Comparison-Across-Meditation-Breathing-Techniques
This project analyzes **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** during various meditation and breathing states using the **PhysioNet HRV dataset**. We compare Chi meditation, Kundalini Yoga, sleep, and metronomic breathing based on time-domain HRV metrics and use **machine learning models** to distinguish between these states.
